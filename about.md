# RevisedLevelCells
Revise level cells just a smidge. Revisions include:
- Level description button (shows level description, song info, and SFX info <cy>if the level has been downloaded</c>)
- Compact Editor Levels (turns your levels in the "My Levels" menu into a compact list) <cl>(Formerly part of ErysEdits)</c>
- Recolor song names based on its source (Default, Newgrounds, Music Library, NCS) <cl>(with additional options to cycle through all song sources a level uses)</c>
- Recolor level name based on its featured status (<cy>Featured</c>, <co>Epic</c>, <cp>Legendary</c>, <cj>Mythic</c>)
- Better blending on `chatFont.fnt` text labels <cl>(primarily for those viewing thumbnails from [cdc's Level Thumbnails mod](mod:cdc.level_thumbnails))</c>
- Remove list placement from level lists <cl>(Requires [Cvolton's Compact Lists mod](mod:cvolton.compact_lists) to be enabled)</c>
